Frame Patterns
==============

Repeating patterns as borders with CSS3 border-image

* [Demo on Github](http://atelierbram.github.io/frame-patterns/)
* [Demo on Codepen](http://codepen.io/atelierbram/pen/vrdKB)

Main goal of this demo and study is to create border-images that can work as dividers, and **can** be used “stand alone” on a single box, but don’t **have** to. That’s why the sides (left, right, top and bottom) sometimes have different positions, because it should be complementary to itself, like puzzle pieces are.

Secondary goal; when making a collection of border-images that are small in file-size and are made out of geometrical shapes, those shapes could possibly be easier to be iterated upon and reused.
