Frame Patterns
==============

Repeating patterns as borders with CSS3 border-image

[Demo](http://atelierbram.github.io/frame-patterns/)

## Objectives

Main goal of this demo and study is to create border-images that can work as dividers, and <em>can</em> be used “stand alone” on a single box, but don’t <em>have</em> to. That’s why the sides (left, right, top and bottom) sometimes have different positions, because it should be complementary to itself, like puzzle pieces are.

Secondary goal; when making a collection of border-images that are small in file-size and are made out of geometrical shapes, those shapes could possibly be easier to be iterated upon and reused.</p>
